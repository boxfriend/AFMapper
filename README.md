3. Edit bookmark if the edit window did not automatically open (typically right click will give the option to edit)

### How to use
While in the ship controls of an undocked ship in an Asteroid Field click the bookmark you created. This will automatically prompt you to download the generated csv file.

#### Supported Platforms
This will likely only work in a desktop environment, does not appear to work on mobile (though you are welcome to try)

#### Other Info
I don't typically use Javascript so the code is probably not ideal, but it does exactly what I needed it to. The code has been made readable and commented in [PrettyCode](PrettyCode.js)
